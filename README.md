Python project to see if we can appy a negative force on an object at a distance using EM rays.

Class uses an Object class which will define a physics object that has coordinates, mass and charge.

The idea is that by placing a couple of objects into a 'universe', we should be able to implement the mechanics to invoke motion in the objects based on gravitation and eventually electromagnetic forces.
